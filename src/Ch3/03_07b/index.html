            <h1>A Shifting Reef</h1>
            <p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which
                doubtless
                no
                one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the
                public
                mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common
                sailors,
                captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the
                Governments
                of several states on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter.</p>

            <p>For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long object, spindle-shaped,
                occasionally
                phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.</p>

            <p>The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the
                shape
                of
                the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of
                locomotion,
                and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those
                hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers
                times,—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet,
                equally
                with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length,—we might fairly
                conclude
                that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day,
                if it
                existed at all. And that it did exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the
                human
                mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this
                supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question.</p>
